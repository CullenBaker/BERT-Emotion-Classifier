# BERT-Emotion-Classifier
This code uses a pretrained BERT model to learn how to classify text by emotions. In this specific case it will be tweets, but it can be used with any series of texts. The training, validation and test data has been attached, but the tweets file was too large to attach. The end result of the analysis is a chart representing the percentage of each emotion by time.
